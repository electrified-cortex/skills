Spawn a zero-context, haiku-class sub-agent in the background:

**Claude Code:** `Agent` tool. Pass: `"Read and follow instructions.txt here. Input: skill_path=<path> --filename claude-haiku [--fix] [--uncompressed]"`

**VS Code / Copilot:** `runSubagent(model: "Claude Haiku 4.5", prompt: "Read and follow instructions.txt in <skill_dir>. Input: skill_path=<path> --filename claude-haiku [--fix] [--uncompressed]")`

Don't read `instructions.txt` yourself.

Returns: `PATH: <abs-path-to-record.md>` on success, `ERROR: <reason>` on pre-write failure.

Non-haiku callers: see `../hash-record/filenames.md` for the canonical `--filename` value.

Don't re-audit unchanged files (cache HIT — see `../iteration-safety/SKILL.md`).
